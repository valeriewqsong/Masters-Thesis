This thesis explores methods to enhance knowledge base updates for enhanced user support. They are conducted in the context of an e-commerce chatbot.

Experiment 1: Building Experimental LLM Chatbot Strategies. 
This study involves the development and implementation of various chatbot strategies. It explores different fine-tuning methods to adapt LLMs as an e-commerce chatbot tailored to helping users find products.

Experiment 2: Designing Dialog Management Strategies.
This investigation explores dialog management strategies to create a context-aware model. We look at drawing from both past and ongoing interactions between the user and model to achieve this. Additionally, techniques such as retrieval-augmented generation is explored for incorporating external data into the LLMs context, enhancing overall conversational abilities.

Experiment 3: Knowledge-Base Update Mechanisms. 
The final investigation in this thesis explores different approaches to update knowledge bases with relevant information from dialogues held between the user and chatbot. This research pre- dominantly involves an extensive review of the unification of knowledge graphs and large language models.
